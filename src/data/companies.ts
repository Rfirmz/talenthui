Known nationwide for its top-selling flagship beers Big Wave Golden Ale and Longboard Island Lager, as well as its refreshing Kona Spiked Island Seltzer, Kona Brewing Hawaii also specializes in its innovative small-batch beers brewed exclusively on and for the Islands. Steps away from the original Kailua-Kona brewery and pub stands the brand's new 300,000-square foot brewery that manufactures and cans the same quality brews to be sold exclusively in Hawai'i. Kona Brewing Hawaii also supports its community through its Makana Giving Program which donates both funds and products to local fundraisers, events, and campaigns.

As one of the most established youth-serving organizations in the region, we empower nearly 4,000 boys and girls each year to become responsible citizens, ethical leaders, and community-minded individuals.  Through exciting programs such as Cub Scouts, Scouts BSA, Sea Scouts, and Venturing, young people experience the wonders of camping, hiking, robotics, community improvement projects, and more. Our Scouts explore over 100 merit badge topics ranging from personal fitness and environmental stewardship to robotics and citizenship, providing them with essential skills for a successful future.  Scouting America's mission is to inspire youth by instilling the values of the Scout Oath and Law, combined with Hawaiian values such as kuleana (responsibility), kokua (help), and malama ka aina (care for the land). With the support of over 2,000 dedicated volunteers, we ensure that every young person in our region has the opportunity to experience the lifelong benefits of Scouting.  Research shows that Scouts are more likely to embrace positive social values, demonstrate leadership, and give back to their communities. At Scouting America, Aloha Council, we remain committed to guiding the next generation of leaders through character development, outdoor adventure, and service to others.",

We do so by investing in promising initiatives and organizations through grantmaking, using our convening power, and introducing and spreading new ideas and approaches to help solve some of Hawaii's most pressing problems. Our 2017 Mission and Strategies:  (1) to close the achievement gap in public education so that all of Hawaii's children, regardless of their socioeconomic background, have access to and benefit from high-quality education, from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, that prepares them for a successful future;  (2) to restore Hawaii's nearshore marine life populations so that future generations can benefit and learn from this rich natural resource;  (3) to build on the strengths of Windward Oahu communities through investments that support the region's rich cultural legacy, its youth and families, and its natural resources; and  (4) to support a limited number of other unforeseen but compelling opportunities to make a big difference in Hawaii's future.  We achieve this mission through grants, which we see as investmentsinvestments in ambitious, creative initiatives that deliver results by clearly making Hawaii a better place for its children, communities, and environment.  Money for those grants comes from the Foundation's endowment, which is managed carefully to ensure that the Foundation can serve as a resource for Hawaii's future generations.  Harold K.L. Castle, owner of Kaneohe Ranch and grandson of one of the early missionary families to Hawaii, established his foundation in 1962, providing much of his wealth to fund the organization.",
